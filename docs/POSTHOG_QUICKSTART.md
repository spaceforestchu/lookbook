# PostHog Analytics - Quick Start

## âœ… What's Been Implemented

PostHog analytics is now fully integrated into your Lookbook app! Here's what's tracking:

### Automatic Tracking
- Page views and time on page
- Session recordings (watch users navigate your site!)
- Click tracking

### Custom Events
- **Filters**: Track which skills/industries users search for
- **Project Views**: See which projects are most popular
- **Person Views**: Track profile visits
- **Navigation**: See how users browse (next/previous clicks)

## ðŸš€ To Activate (2 Minutes)

### Step 1: Get Your PostHog API Key

1. Go to **https://posthog.com** and sign up (FREE account)
2. Create a new project
3. Copy your **Project API Key** (starts with `phc_...`)

### Step 2: Add API Key to Your App

Create a file at `/frontend/.env.local`:

```env
VITE_POSTHOG_API_KEY=phc_your_actual_key_here
VITE_POSTHOG_HOST=https://us.i.posthog.com
```

### Step 3: Restart Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Look for `âœ… PostHog initialized` in your browser console.

### Step 4: Watch the Magic âœ¨

1. Navigate around your site
2. Go to PostHog dashboard â†’ "Live Events" to see events in real-time
3. Go to "Session Recordings" to **watch videos of users** navigating your site!

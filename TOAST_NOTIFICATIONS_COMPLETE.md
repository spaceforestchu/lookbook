  description: 'Details about what happened'
});
```

toast.error('Action failed', {
  description: 'Error details or suggestions'
});

toast.info('Processing...', {
  description: 'Current status or progress'
});

toast.warning('Partial success', {
  description: 'Some items succeeded, some failed'
});
```

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
- Generic browser alerts (blocking)
- No visual feedback on success
- Poor error messaging
- Interrupts user workflow

### After
- Beautiful, non-blocking notifications
- Clear success feedback
- Descriptive error messages
- Auto-dismissing (doesn't interrupt)
- Consistent design across admin portal

## Visual Features

- **Position**: Top-right corner (non-intrusive)
- **Rich Colors**: Green (success), Red (error), Blue (info), Orange (warning)
- **Auto-dismiss**: Toasts disappear automatically after a few seconds
- **Swipe to dismiss**: Users can swipe notifications away
- **Stacking**: Multiple toasts stack nicely
- **Accessible**: Screen reader friendly
- **Animations**: Smooth slide-in/out animations

## Examples of Toast Messages

### Person Management
- "Person created successfully! - Alice Johnson has been added to the lookbook."
- "Person updated successfully! - Changes to Alice Johnson have been saved."
- "Failed to save person - Slug already exists"

### Project Management
- "Project created successfully! - My Amazing Project has been added to the lookbook."
- "Project updated successfully! - Changes to My Amazing Project have been saved."
- "Failed to save project - Title is required"

### Bulk Upload
- "File selected - people_upload.csv is ready to upload"
- "Processing file... - Uploading 25 people..."
- "Upload completed successfully! - Successfully uploaded 25 people"
- "Upload completed with errors - 20 succeeded, 5 failed"

### Login
- "Welcome back! - Successfully logged in to admin portal"
- "Login failed - Invalid username or password"

## Technical Implementation

### Import Toast
```javascript
import { toast } from 'sonner';
```

### Use in Component
```javascript
try {
  await saveData();
  toast.success('Saved!', {
    description: 'Your changes have been saved.'
  });
} catch (error) {
  toast.error('Save failed', {
    description: error.message
  });
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Better UX**: Users get immediate, clear feedback
2. **Non-blocking**: Doesn't interrupt workflow like alerts
3. **Professional**: Looks polished and modern
4. **Consistent**: Same notification style everywhere
5. **Accessible**: Works with screen readers
6. **Informative**: Provides context and details
7. **Customizable**: Easy to add more toast types

## Future Enhancements

### Special Formatting Rules

**People:**

- Multiple industries: Use commas (e.g., "Finance,Healthcare")
- Multiple highlights: Use pipe | character (e.g., "Achievement 1|Achievement 2")
- Open to work: Use "true" or "false" (case-sensitive)
- Slug: Must be unique and URL-friendly (lowercase, hyphens, no spaces)

**Projects:**
- Multiple technologies: Use commas (e.g., "React,Node.js,PostgreSQL")
- Multiple sectors: Use commas (e.g., "B2B,Fintech,Consumer")
- Suggested sectors: B2B, Fintech, Consumer, Education, Healthcare, Real Estate and Construction, Industrials, Government
- Slug: Must be unique and URL-friendly (lowercase, hyphens, no spaces)
- URLs: Include full URL with https://

### Results Display

After upload, you'll see:
- **Total Rows**: Number of rows processed from CSV
- **Successful**: Number of successfully created records (green)
- **Failed**: Number of failed records (red)

Failed records show:
- Row number
- Name/title from that row
- Specific error message (e.g., "duplicate slug", "missing required field")

### Error Handling

The system will:
- Continue processing even if some rows fail
- Show detailed error messages for failed rows
- Successfully create records that pass validation
- Handle duplicate slugs gracefully

Common errors:
- Duplicate slug (already exists in database)
- Missing required fields (name, title, slug)
- Invalid data format
- Malformed CSV structure

### Navigation

Access bulk upload from:
- Admin sidebar: "Bulk Upload" link
- Located at `/admin/bulk-upload`

After successful upload:
- "View People/Projects" button - Navigate to list page
- "Upload More" button - Reset form for another upload

## Technical Details

### Frontend
- Uses `papaparse` library for CSV parsing
- Client-side parsing and validation
- Sequential API calls for each row
- Real-time progress and error tracking

### Backend
- Uses existing POST `/api/profiles` and `/api/projects` endpoints
- No special bulk endpoint needed
- Standard validation rules apply
- Each record created independently

### File Requirements
- File type: CSV (.csv)
- Encoding: UTF-8
- Format: Standard CSV with header row
- Size: No strict limit (but large files may take longer)

## Usage Tips

1. **Start with Template**: Always download and use the provided template
2. **Test with Small Batches**: Upload 2-3 records first to verify format
3. **Unique Slugs**: Ensure all slugs are unique across your entire dataset
4. **URL Format**: Always include `https://` in URLs
5. **Special Characters**: Avoid special characters in slugs
6. **Backup Data**: Keep a copy of your CSV file before uploading

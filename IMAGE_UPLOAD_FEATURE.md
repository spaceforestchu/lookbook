# ðŸ“¸ Direct Image Upload Feature

## Overview

You can now upload images directly to the database instead of just linking to external URLs. Images are converted to base64 format and stored in the existing URL fields.

## Features

### **Main Image Upload**
- **Max Size**: 5MB
- **Supported Formats**: PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, SVG, WebP
- **Storage**: Base64 encoded in `main_image_url` field
- **Toggle**: Switch between "URL" and "Upload" modes

### **Project Icon Upload**
- **Max Size**: 2MB
- **Supported Formats**: PNG, JPG, JPEG, SVG (SVG recommended for best quality)
- **Storage**: Base64 encoded in `icon_url` field
- **Toggle**: Switch between "URL" and "Upload" modes

## How to Use

### Uploading Images

1. **Go to Admin â†’ Projects â†’ Edit Project**
2. **In the Media section**, you'll see two buttons: **URL** and **Upload**
3. **Click "Upload"** to switch to upload mode
4. **Click the upload area** or drag and drop an image
5. **See instant preview** of the uploaded image
6. **Save the project** - the image is stored as base64 in the database

### Using External URLs

1. **Click "URL"** to switch back to URL mode
2. **Paste the image URL** in the text field
3. **Save the project**

## Benefits

âœ… **No External Dependencies**: Images are stored directly in the database  
âœ… **No Broken Links**: Images won't disappear if external URLs change  
âœ… **Quick Upload**: Drag and drop or click to upload  
âœ… **Instant Preview**: See images before saving  
âœ… **Flexible**: Use URLs or uploads, or mix both  
âœ… **Toast Notifications**: Get feedback during upload process  

## Technical Details

### How It Works

1. **User selects file** from their computer
2. **File is validated** (type and size)
3. **FileReader API** converts image to base64 data URL
4. **Base64 string** is stored in formData
5. **On save**, base64 is sent to backend
6. **Backend stores** the base64 string in PostgreSQL text field
7. **On display**, browser renders base64 as image source

### Base64 Format

```
data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAA...
```

The browser natively supports base64 data URLs in `<img src="">` tags, so no special handling is needed for display.

### Storage Considerations

- **Base64 encoding increases size by ~33%**
- **5MB file** â†’ ~6.6MB as base64
- **2MB icon** â†’ ~2.6MB as base64
- PostgreSQL `text` fields have no practical size limit for these images
- Consider using URLs for very large images if database size is a concern

## File Size Limits

### Main Images: 5MB
- Typical 1920x1080 screenshot: 500KB - 2MB
- High-res project image: 2MB - 5MB

### Icons: 2MB
- SVG icons: Usually < 50KB
- PNG icons (512x512): 100KB - 500KB

## Validation & Error Handling

### Automatic Validation
- âœ… File type checking (must be image/*)
- âœ… File size validation
- âœ… Error messages via toast notifications
- âœ… Preview error handling

### Toast Messages
- **Info**: "Uploading image..." (during conversion)
- **Success**: "Image uploaded!" (when complete)
- **Error**: "File too large" or "Invalid file type"

## Browser Compatibility

Base64 image encoding is supported in all modern browsers:
- âœ… Chrome/Edge (all versions)
- âœ… Firefox (all versions)
- âœ… Safari (all versions)
- âœ… Mobile browsers

## Migration from URLs

If you have existing projects with URL-based images:
1. They will continue to work normally
2. You can switch to uploads by editing the project
3. Upload a new image to replace the URL
4. Both methods work seamlessly together

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Image compression before upload
- Multiple image uploads at once
- Image editing (crop, resize)
- Drag & drop directly on the upload area
- Thumbnail generation
- External storage integration (S3, Cloudinary)
